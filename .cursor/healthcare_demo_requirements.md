# Healthcare AI Demo - Technical Requirements & Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
You are building a healthcare demonstration for Snowflake showing how medical professionals can leverage AI to analyze patient notes for improved clinical decision-making, population health management, and medical research. This is a DEMO for healthcare customers, showcasing practical AI applications in medicine.

## Core Architecture Decision
**HYBRID APPROACH**: Combine pre-processed insights (for performance) with real-time AI demonstrations (for impact)

## Cursor Development Rules

### 1. Decision Making
- For complex medical/clinical decisions, ask for clarification
- For technical implementation choices, proceed with best practices
- When medical accuracy matters, err on the side of caution
- Document assumptions about medical workflows

### 2. Development Phases
- **Foundation Phase**: Focus on robust data structures and connections
- **AI Development**: Prioritize prompt accuracy and medical relevance  
- **UI Development**: Emphasize physician-friendly interfaces
- **Testing Phase**: Ensure medical scenarios are realistic and valuable

### 3. Healthcare-Specific Guidelines
- Never generate fake medical advice in demos
- Always include disclaimers about demo vs production use
- Respect medical terminology and clinical workflows
- Focus on augmenting, not replacing, clinical judgment

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
```python
# Every medical analysis function must include:
# 1. Purpose documentation
# 2. Medical context
# 3. Error handling
# 4. Result validation

def analyze_patient_notes(patient_notes: str) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze patient notes for clinical insights.
    
    Medical Context: Generates differential diagnoses based on 
    presenting symptoms and clinical findings.
    
    Args:
        patient_notes: Unstructured clinical notes
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing diagnoses, confidence scores, and evidence
    """
    try:
        # Implementation
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        # Always gracefully handle errors in medical context
        return {"error": str(e), "fallback": get_cached_result()}
```

### Prompt Engineering Standards
- Start with role definition ("You are a board-certified physician...")
- Include clear medical context
- Request structured output
- Specify confidence levels
- Ask for evidence/reasoning

### Error Handling
- Never show raw errors to demo users
- Always have fallback content ready
- Log errors for debugging
- Provide helpful user messages
- Maintain demo flow despite failures

## Demo-Specific Allowances

### Acceptable Shortcuts
- Pre-computed results for complex analyses
- Simplified medical scoring (vs full clinical algorithms)
- Representative patient samples (vs processing all 167k)
- Mock processing delays for realism
- Curated demo scenarios

### Not Acceptable
- Inventing medical facts or studies
- Showing impossible processing speeds
- Making definitive medical diagnoses
- Ignoring medical safety/ethics
- Using non-medical terminology

## Performance Requirements

### Batch Processing
- Process 1000 patients/hour minimum
- Store results in enriched tables
- Track processing status
- Handle failures gracefully

### Real-Time Processing  
- Response within 30 seconds
- Show progress indicators
- Cache results for reuse
- Fallback to pre-computed if needed
